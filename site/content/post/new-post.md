## **Executive Summary**

The executive summary is one of the most important parts of your
business plan. Itâ€™s an opportunity to provide an overview of your

target market. Itâ€™s important to include market analysis to back up your
points. Explain how your solution fits in to solve the problem you have
identified.

*BIT TIP: Before you begin, understand who the audience is for this

Include a cash flow forecast, initial investment, and timeline for
profitability. This is your opportunity to showcase your current

## **Appendix**Â 

If you have any additional charts or further details you want to

Write your business plan according to your industry, needs and project
scope.
